# Map
This python project was a school project that I decided to modify on my own. It represent the map of the world with different colour code for the density of the population, Volcanoes name and elevation from green to red depending on high they are and national parks in Canada and the USA. It can be seen in Stamen Terrain or Open Street Map and the markers can also be removed or added.

The world and Volcanoes files were given to me during the course. The CanadaVolcanoes, NPcanada and USANP CSV files were generated from information I gathered.

I put together a layered map with two choice of terrain for the main map and different choices for layered markers and a coloured map.

The color coded population map is from green to yellow to red the higher the population.
